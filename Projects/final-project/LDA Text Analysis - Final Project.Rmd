#Here we're trying to load the RDS file for text analysis that we saved during Data Wrangling

```{r pressure, echo = TRUE}

LDAAnalysisDataset <- readRDS("Saved RDS Files/LDATopicAnalysisData.rds") 

#Tokenizing the text

tokenizedLDADataset <- LDAAnalysisDataset %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = Title) %>%
  select(Primary_Country, word)

#Getting rid of the stop words

data(stop_words)

tokenizedLDADataset_stopped <- tokenizedLDADataset %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

class(tokenizedLDADataset_stopped)

#covid_lda <- LDA(tokenizedLDADataset_stopped, k = 2, control = list(seed = 1234))




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
