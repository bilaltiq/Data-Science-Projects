COVID Cases Dataset:

casesCountryData <- read_csv("COVID Datasets/dailyCases.csv")

casesCountryDataSelected <- casesCountryData %>%
  select(cases, deaths, countriesAndTerritories)

    Cases = sum(cases)
  )

LDA Topic Analysis Dataset:
ss
```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}

topicAnalysisData <- read_excel("COVID Datasets/topicAnalysisData.xlsx")

topicAnalysisDataSelected <- topicAnalysisData %>%
  select(Reported_On, Title, Publication_Date, Primary_Country, Primary_Language) %>%
  filter(Primary_Language == "English")

# The reason why we're filtering the Primary language to be English is because there were entries which weren't in English, which would not make it suitable for LDA topic analysis.

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
